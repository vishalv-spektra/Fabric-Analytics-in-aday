# Introduction

In our scenario, Supplier Data is in Snowflake, Customer Data is in Dataverse, and Employee Data is in SharePoint. All these data sources are updated at different times. To minimize the number of data refreshes for Dataflows, we are going to create individual Dataflows for Snowflake and SharePoint data sources.

>**Note:** Multiple data sources are supported in a single Dataflow.

The IT team has already established a link to Dataverse and applied the necessary data transformations, mirroring those in the Power BI Desktop file. They have ingested this data into the Lakehouse in the Admin workspace and have given us access to the tables. We are going to create a shortcut to the tables the Lakehouse IT team has created.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

- How to connect to SharePoint using Dataflow Gen2 and ingest data into Lakehouse

- How to connect to Snowflake using Dataflow Gen2 and ingest data into Lakehouse

- How to ingest data from a Shared Lakehouse

# Dataflow Gen2

## Task 1: Copy SharePoint queries to Dataflow

1. Let’s navigate back to the Fabric workspace, **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>** **(1)** you created in Lab 2, Task 8.

2. Select **+ New item (2)** option available in the upper left corner.

3. Under the **Get Data (3)** section, select **Dataflow Gen2 (4)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image6.png)

    Leave the default name and ensure “Enable Git integration” is checked. Then select **Create**. You will be navigated to the **Dataflow page**. The Dataflow Gen2 interface is like Power Query in Power BI Desktop. We can copy queries from Power BI Desktop into Dataflow Gen2. Let’s give this a try.

4. If you have not already opened it, open the **FAIAD.pbix** located in **Reports** folder on the desktop of your lab environment.

5. From the ribbon select **Home -> Transform data**. Power Query window opens. As you have noticed in the earlier labs, queries in the left panel are organized by data source.

6. From the left panel, under the SharePointData folder, select the **People** query.

7. **Right-click** and select **Copy**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image7.png)

8. Navigate back to the **Dataflow screen** in the browser.

9. In the **Dataflow pane**, enter **Ctrl+V** (currently, right-click paste is not supported). If you are using a Mac device, please use Cmd+V to paste.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image8.png)

    >**Note:** If you are working in the lab environment, please select the ellipsis on the top right of the screen. Use the slider to **enable** **VM Native Clipboard**. Select OK in the dialog. Once done pasting the queries you can disable this option.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image9.png)

    Notice the query has been pasted and is available in the left panel. Since we do not have a connection created to SharePoint, you will see a warning message requesting you to configure the connection. 
    ![](../media/Lab-4/image10.png)

## Task 2: Create SharePoint connection

1. Select **Configure connection**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image11.png)


2. Connect to data source dialog opens. In the **Connection** dropdown, make sure **Create new connection** is selected.


3. **Authentication kind** should be **Organizational account**.


4. Select **Connect**.

    >**Note:** You will be signed in using your credentials. They will be different than the screenshot below.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image12.png)

## Task 3: Configure Data destination for People query

The connection is established, and you can view the data in the preview panel. Feel free to navigate through the Applied Steps of the queries. Now we need to ingest the People data into the Lakehouse.


1. Select **People (1)** query.


2. From the ribbon select **Home -> Query (2) -> Add data destination (3) -> Lakehouse (4)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image13.png)


3. Connect to data destination dialog opens. We need to create a new Connection to the Lakehouse. With **Create new connection** selected in the Connection dropdown and **Authentication kind** set to **Organizational account**, select **Next**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image14.png)


4. Choose destination target dialog opens. Make sure the **New table** radio button is selected, since we are creating a new table.


5. We want to create the table in the Lakehouse we created earlier. In the left panel, navigate to **Lakehouse -> FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**.


6. Select **lh_FAIAD**


7. Leave the table name as **People**


8. Select **Next**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image15.png)


9. Choose destination settings dialog opens. Make sure “**Use automatic settings**” is **enabled**.

    >**Note:** You can disable automatic settings and notice you have options to set Update method and Schema options. Once done exploring, make sure “**Use automatic settings**” is **enabled**.


10. Select **Save settings**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image16.png)

## Task 4: Publish and Rename SharePoint Dataflow

1. You will be navigated back to the **Power Query window**. Notice on the bottom **right corner**, Data destination is set to **Lakehouse (1)**.

2. In the upper left corner, select **Save & run (2)**. Once you see the notification that a refresh has been started you can close out of the dataflow **(3)**

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image17.png)

    >**Note:** You will be navigated back to **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> workspace**. It may take a few moments for the Dataflow to finish running.

3. **Dataflow 1** is the dataflow we were working on. Let’s rename it before we continue. Click on the **ellipsis (…)** next to Dataflow 1. Select **Settings** (While the Dataflow is running you cannot access the settings).

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image18.png)

4. Dataflow settings window opens. Change the **name** to **df_People_SharePoint (1)**.

5. In the **Description** text box add **Dataflow to ingest People data from SharePoint to Lakehouse (2)**.

6. Once done, close out of the settings window **(3)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image19.png)

    You will be navigated back to **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> workspace** .

7. Select **lh_FAIAD** to navigate to the lakehouse.

8. Make sure you are in the Lakehouse view (not SQL analytics endpoint).

9. Notice **People** table is now available in the Lakehouse.
         
    ![](../media/Lab-4/image20.png)

    >**Note:** If you do not see the newly created tables, select the ellipsis next to Tables and select refresh to refresh the Tables.

## Task 5: Copy Snowflake queries to Dataflow

1. Let’s navigate back to the Fabric workspace, **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)**.

2. Select **+ New item (2)** option available in the upper left corner.

3. Under Recommended items, select **Dataflow Gen2 (3)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image21.png)

    Leave the default name and ensure “Enable Git integration” is checked. Then select **Create**. If you receive a message stating “A dataflow with this name already exists,” then change the name to **Dataflow 2**. You will be navigated to the **Dataflow page**. Now that we are familiar with Dataflow, let’s go ahead and copy the queries from Power BI Desktop into Dataflow.

4. If you have not already opened it, open the **FAIAD.pbix** located in **Reports** folder on the desktop of your lab environment.

5. From the ribbon select **Home -> Transform data**. Power Query window opens. As you have noticed in the earlier lab, queries in the left panel are organized by data source.

6. From the left panel, under the **SnowflakeData** folder **Ctrl+Select** or Shift+Select the following queries:

    1. SupplierCategories

    2. Suppliers

    3. Supplier

    4. PO

    5. PO Line Items

7. **Right-click** and select **Copy**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image22.png)

8. Navigate back to the **browser**.

9. In the **Dataflow pane**, select the **center pane**, and enter **Ctrl+V** (currently, right-click paste is not supported). If you are using a Mac device, please use Cmd+V to paste.

    >**Note:** If you are working in the lab environment, please select the **ellipsis (…)** on the top right of the screen. Use the slider to **enable** **VM Native Clipboard**. Select OK in the dialog. Once done pasting the queries you can disable this option.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image23.png)

## Task 6: Create connection to Snowflake

Notice the five queries are pasted and now you have the Queries panel on the left. Since we do not have a connection created for Snowflake, you will see a warning message requesting you to configure the connection.

1. Select **Configure connection**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image24.png)

2. Connect to data source dialog opens. In the **Connection** dropdown, make sure **Create new connection** is selected.

3. **Authentication kind** should be **Snowflake**.

4. Enter the **Snowflake Username** and **Snowflake Password** provided below. Use these credentials to connect all the tables under **Snowflake** to Snowflake and then select **Connect**.

    - Snowflake Username: <inject key="SnowFlake Username" enableCopy="false" />

    - Snowflake Password: <inject key="SnowFlake Password" enableCopy="false" />

    >**Note**: If you encounter any issues connecting to Snowflake using the credentials from the environment details, please use the credentials provided below.

    - **Snowflake Username:** SNOWFLAKE_BACKUP

    - **Snowflake Password:** 8UpfRpExVDXv2AC1

5. Select **Connect**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image25.png)

    The connection is established, and you can view the data in the preview panel. Feel free to navigate through the Applied Steps of the queries. Basically, the Suppliers query has the details of suppliers, and SupplierCategories, as the name implies, has all the supplier categories. These two tables are joined to create the Supplier dimension, with the columns we need. Similarly, we have PO Line Items merged with PO to create the PO fact. Now we need to ingest the Supplier and PO data into the Lakehouse.

## Task 7: Configure Data Destination for Supplier and PO queries


1. Select the **Supplier (1)** query.

2. From the ribbon select **Home (2) -> Add data destination (3) -> Lakehouse (4)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image26.png)

3. Connect to data destination dialog opens. From the **Connection dropdown**, select **Lakehouse odl_user_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> (none)**.


4. Select **Next**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image27.png)


5. Choose destination target dialog opens. Make sure the **New table** radio button is selected, since we are creating a new table.


6. We want to create the table in the Lakehouse we created earlier. In the left panel, navigate to **Lakehouse -> FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**.


7. Select **lh_FAIAD**


8. Leave the table name as **Supplier**


9. Select **Next**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image28.png)

10. Choose destination settings dialog opens. We will use the automatic settings as this will do a full update of the data. Also, it will rename the columns as needed. Select **Save settings**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image29.png)


11. You will be navigated back to the **Power Query window**. Notice on the bottom **right corner**, **Data destination** is set to **Lakehouse**. Similarly, **set up the data destination for the PO query**. Once it is done, your **PO** query should have **Data destination** set to **Lakehouse** as shown in the screenshot below.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image30.png)

## Task 8: Rename and Publish Snowflake Dataflow


1. From the top of the screen, select the **arrow next to Dataflow 2 (name may be different)** to rename.


2. In the dialog, change the name to **df_Supplier_Snowflake**


3. Click on **Enter** to save the name change.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image31.png)


4. In the upper left corner, select **Save & run (1)**. Once you see the notification that a refresh has been started you can close out of the dataflow **(2)**

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image32.png)

    You will be navigated back to **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/> workspace**. It may take a few moments for the dataflow to publish.


5. Select **lh_FAIAD** to navigate to the lakehouse.


6. Make sure you are in the Lakehouse view (not SQL analytics endpoint).


7. Notice the **PO** and **Supplier** table are now available in the Lakehouse.
         
    ![](../media/Lab-4/image33.png)

    >**Note:** If you do not see the newly created tables, select the ellipsis next to Tables and select refresh to refresh the Tables.

    Now let’s create a shortcut to bring in data from Dataverse.

# Shortcut to Internal Lakehouse

## Task 9: How to create a Shortcut to Dataverse

You should be in the Lakehouse **lh_FAIAD**. Make sure you are in Lakehouse view (not SQL analytics endpoint).

![](../media/Lab-4/image34.png)


1. In **Explorer** panel, select the **ellipsis** next to **Tables**.


2. Select **New Shortcut**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image35.png)


3. New shortcut dialog opens. Under **External sources**, select **Dataverse**.

    >**Note:** In the previous lab, we followed similar steps to create a shortcut to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image36.png)


4. **Select New connection (1)**, Connection settings dialog opens. Enter **org6c18814a.crm.dynamics.com (2)** as the **Environment domain**.


5. Leave **Authentication kind** as **Organizational account (3)**.

6. Select **Sign in** if you are not already logged in.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image37.png)

7. From the sign in dialog box, select the **user account** you have been using for these labs. 

    >**Note:** Your account will be different than the screenshot below.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image38.png)

8. Select **Next** in Connection settings dialog.

    You will be navigated to a dialog where you can pick the different bucket/directory from Dataverse. Notice there are a lot of different buckets available. We could pick the bucket(s) we need and follow the process like Lab 3 (use Visual query to transform data and create views). We could also use Dataflow Gen2 like we used earlier in this lab to connect to SharePoint.

    In our scenario, the IT team has already established a link to Dataverse and applied the necessary data transformations, mirroring those in the Power BI Desktop file. They have ingested this data into the Lakehouse in the Admin workspace and given us access to the table(s). Since our IT team has done all the hard work, we can create a shortcut to this Lakehouse in Admin workspace.

9. Select **Cancel** in the New shortcut dialog to navigate back to the Lakehouse.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image39.png)

## Task 10: Create a Shortcut to a Lakehouse


1. In **Explorer** panel, select the **ellipsis** next to **Tables**.

2. Select **New Shortcut**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image35.png)

3. New shortcut dialog opens. Select **Microsoft OneLake** option under Internal sources.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image40.png)


4. Select **lh_dataverse**.


5. Select **Next**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image41.png)

6. In the left panel, expand **lh_dataverse -> Tables**. Notice the IT admin has provided access to the Customer table.


7. Select **Customer**.


8. Select **Next**.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image42.png)


9. Select **Create** on the next dialog. You will be navigated back to lh_FAIAD lakehouse.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image43.png)


10. In the **Explorer** panel on the left, notice the new **Customer** table has been created.


11. Select **Customer** table to view the data in the preview panel.

    ![](../media/Lab-4/image44.png)

    We have successfully created a shortcut to another Lakehouse.

    We have now ingested all the needed data into our Lakehouse. In the next lab we will schedule a refresh for our SharePoint Dataflow.
