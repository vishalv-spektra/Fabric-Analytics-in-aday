4. In the **Name** field enter **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**
        
    >***Note:** The workspace name must be unique. Make sure a green check mark with "This name is available" is displayed below the Name field.*

5. If you choose, you can enter a Description for the workspace. This is an optional field.

6. Click on **Advanced** to expand the section.

    ![](../media/Lab-2/image15.png)

7. Under **License mode**, make sure **Trial** is selected. (It should be selected by default.)


8. Select **Apply** to create a new workspace.

    ![](../media/Lab-2/image16.png)

    You’ll be navigated to your newly created workspace. We will bring data from the different data sources into a Lakehouse and use the data from the Lakehouse to build our model and report on it. The first step is to create a Lakehouse. We will do this next.

## Task 3: Create a Lakehouse

1. In the newly created workspace **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**, locate the **+ New item (1)** button on the left-hand navigation pane. This is where you can begin creating new items in your workspace.

2. In the search box, type **Lakehouse (2)** and, from the search results, select the **Lakehouse (3)** option. This will enable you to create a new Lakehouse to store, query, and manage your big data.

    ![](../media/Lab-2/image17.png)

3. A new lakehouse dialog will appear. Enter **lh_FAIAD** in the Name textbox.
         
    >**Note:** lh here refers to Lakehouse. We are prefixing lh so that it is easy to identify and search.         
    
    >**Note:** This feature is no longer in preview **but we still do not need to enable it**.

1. Make sure **Lakehouse schemas (2)** is unchecked.

1. Then, select **Create (3)** to proceed.
         
    ![](../media/Lab-2/image18.png)

    >**Note:** **Please make sure to deselect the Lakehouse Schema feature, as it is now enabled by default.**

    Within a few moments, a Lakehouse is created, and you will be navigated to the Lakehouse explorer interface. On the top left, next to the Fabric name in the header, you will have the Lakehouse icon. The workspace icon on the left navigation will reflect that it now contains an item

    Within the Lakehouse Explorer, you will notice a Tables and Files section. A Lakehouse could expose Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 files under the files section, or a dataflow could load data to Lakehouse tables. There are various options available. We are going to show you some of the options in the following labs.
