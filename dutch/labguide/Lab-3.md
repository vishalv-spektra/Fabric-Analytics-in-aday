# Introduction

In our scenario, Sales Data comes from the ERP system and is stored in an ADLS Gen2. It gets updated at noon / 12 PM every day. We need to transform and ingest this data into Lakehouse and use it in our model.

There are multiple ways to ingest this data.

- **Shortcuts:** This creates a link to the data, and we can use Visual query views to transform it. We are going to use Shortcuts in this lab.

- **Notebooks:** This requires us to write code. It is a developer friendly approach.

- **Dataflow Gen2:** You are probably familiar with Power Query or Dataflow Gen1. Dataflow Gen2, as the name indicates, is the newer version of Dataflow. It provides all the capabilities of Power Query / Dataflow Gen1 with the added ability to transform and ingest data into multiple data sources. We are going to introduce this in the next couple of labs.

- **Pipeline:** This is an orchestration tool. Activities can be orchestrated to extract, transform, and ingest data. We will be using A pipeline to execute Dataflow Gen2 activity which in turn will perform extraction, transformation, and ingestion.

We will start by creating a Shortcut to ingest data into a Lakehouse from ADLS Gen2 data source. Once ingested, we are going to use Visual query views to transform it.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

- How to create Shortcuts in your Lakehouse

- How to transform data using the Visual query feature

# Shortcut to ADLS Gen2

## Task 1: Create Shortcut

Shortcuts are used to create a link to the target location. Shortcuts provide access to the data without needing to physically move the data into the lakehouse. This is like creating shortcuts in Windows desktop.

1. In the top of your screen select the **lh_FAIAD** tab to navigate to the Lakehouse.

1. If you don’t have a tab you can navigate back to your Workspace and open the Lakehouse from there.

1. In the **Explorer** panel, select the **ellipsis** next to **Tables**.

1. Select **New shortcut**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image6.png)

1. **New Shortcut** dialog opens. Under **External sources**, select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image7.png)

1. Select **New connection (1)**.

1. Enter the following link for the **URL** property: https://stvnextblobstorage.dfs.core.windows.net/fabrikam-sales **(2):**

1. Click on **Create New Connection (3)** under the Connection section

1. Select **Shared Access Signature (SAS) (4)** from the Authentication kind dropdown.

1. Copy the SAS token and paste it into the SAS token **(5)** field.

    - **SAS token:** <inject key="Sas token"></inject>

1. Select **Next (6)** on the bottom right of the screen.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image8.png)

1. You will be connected to ADLS Gen2 with the directory structure displayed in the left panel. Expand **Delta-Parquet-Format-FY25 (1)**.

1. **Select** the following directories **(2)** and then click on **Next (3):**

    1. Application.Cities

    2. Application.Countries

    3. Application.StateProvinces

    4. DateDim

    5. Sales.BuyingGroups

    6. Sales.Customers

    7. Sales.InvoiceLines

    8. Sales.Invoices

    9. Warehouse.StockGroups

    10. Warehouse.StockItemStockGroups

    11. Warehouse.StockItems

    >**Note:** Sales.Invoices_May is the only directory that is **not** selected.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image9.png)

1. You will be navigated to the next dialog where we can edit the names. Select the **Edit icon (1)** under Actions for **Application.Cities**.

1. Rename **Application.Cities to Cities (2)**.

1. Select the check mark next to the name to save the change **(3)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image10.png)

1. Similarly, rename the Shortcut Names as below:

    1. Application.Countries to **Countries**

    2. Application.StateProvinces to **States**

    3. DateDim to **Date**

    4. Sales.BuyingGroups to **BuyingGroups**

    5. Sales.Customers to **Customers**

    6. Sales.InvoiceLines to **InvoiceLineItems**

    7. Sales.Invoices to **Invoices**

    8. Warehouse.StockGroups to **ProductGroups**

    9. Warehouse.StockItemStockGroups to **ProductItemGroup**

    10. Warehouse.StockItems to **ProductItem**

    > **Note:** Double check the names. A typo will cause errors during the lab.

1. Select **Create** to create the Shortcut.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image11.png)

1. Notice all the Shortcuts are created as Tables. Select **BuyingGroups** table and notice we can see a preview of the data in the data panel.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image12.png)

    The next step is to transform the data, so we can create a semantic model. We are going to create views to transform the data.

# Transform data using Visual Query

## Task 2: Create Geo view using Visual Query

1. We can access the Lakehouse using a SQL endpoint. This provides the ability to query the data and create views. On the **top right** of the screen, select **Lakehouse (1) -> SQL analytics endpoint (2)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image13.png)

    You will be navigated to SQL analytics endpoint. You have a new item now in your top navigation and can move back to the Lakehouse by selecting that tab. Notice the Explorer panel has changed. You now can create views, stored procedures, queries and more. We are going to create a visual query as it provides a low code, like Power Query, interface. We will save the result as a view.

    We will start by creating a Geo view. We need to merge data from the Cities, States and Countries tables to create the Geo view.

2. From the top menu, click the drop down next to **New SQL query (1)** and then select **New visual query (2)**.
    
    ![](../media/Lab-3/image14.png)

3. To build a query, we need to add tables to the Visual Query panel. In the Explorer pane, click **Schemas (1)**, expand **dbo (2)**, open **Tables (3)**, click the ellipsis next to **Cities (4)**, and select **Insert into canvas (5)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image15.png)

4. Repeat the same steps for the **States** and **Countries** tables.

    Next, we need to merge these queries. The visual query editor comes with the option to use Power Query editor. Let’s use this, since we are familiar with this because of Power BI.

5. **From the menu in Visual query editor**, select the **Open in popup** icon (towards the right). You will be navigated to Power Query editor.
         
    >***Note:** You may have to scroll to the right or re-open your visual query tab if you do not immediately see this icon*

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image16.png)

6. With **Cities(1)** query selected, from the Power Query editor ribbon, select **Home (2) -> Combine (3) -> Merge queries dropdown (4) -> Merge queries as new (5)**. Merge queries dialog opens.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image17.png)

7. In the **Left table for merge**, select **Cities**.


8. In the **Right table for merge**, select **States**.


9. Select **StateProvinceID** columns from both the tables. We are going to join using this column.


10. Select **Inner** as the **Join kind**.


11. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image18.png)

    Notice a new query called **Merge** has been created. We need a few columns from States.

12. In the **Data view** (bottom panel), click on the **double arrow** next to the **States** column (last column to the right).

13. A panel opens. Ensure that the only selected columns are the following:

    1. StateProvinceCode

    2. StateProvinceName

    3. CountryID

    4. SalesTerritory

14. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image19.png)

    We need to merge Countries query now.

15. With the Merge query selected **(1)**, select **Home (2) -> Combine (3) -> Merge queries dropdown (4) -> Merge queries (5)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image20.png)


16. Merge query dialog opens. In the **Right table for merge**, select **Countries**.


17. Select **CountryID** columns from both the tables. We are going to join using this column.


18. Select **Inner** as the **Join kind**.


19. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image21.png)

    We need a few columns from Countries.

20. In the **Data view** (bottom panel), click on the **double arrow** next to the **Countries** column.

21. A panel opens. Ensure that the only selected columns are the following:

    1. CountryName

    2. FormalName

    3. IsoAlpha3Code

    4. IsoNumericCode

    5. CountryType

    6. Continent

    7. Region

    8. Subregion

22. Select **OK**.

    **Important:** Make sure to scroll down and select all eight columns listed in step 21. The screenshot below only displays the first 5 columns due to a UI limitation.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image22.png)

    We do not need all the columns in the **Merge** table. Make sure to only select those that we need.


23. With **Merge** query selected (1), from the ribbon select **Home (2) -> Choose columns (3) -> Choose columns (4)**.

    >**Note:** If the Choose columns option is not visible, you can find it under Manage columns.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image23.png)

24. Choose columns dialog opens. **Uncheck** the following columns.

    1. StateProvinceID

    2. Location

    3. LastEditedBy

    4. ValidFrom

    5. ValidTo

    6. CountryID

25. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image24.png)

    Notice the process is like Power Query, we have all the steps recorded both in the Applied Steps panel on the right and the visual view. Let’s rename Merge query and Enable load, so that the data is loaded from this query.


26. **Right-click** on the **Merge** query in the Queries (left) panel. Select **Rename** and rename the query to **Geo**.


27. **Right-click** on the **Geo** query in the Queries (left) panel. Select **Enable Load** to enable this query.


28. Make sure that the Cities, States and Countries queries are **disabled**.


29. Select **Save,** found in the bottom right of the power query editor.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image25.png)

    We will be navigated to the Visual query editor. Let’s now save this query as a view.

    >**Note:** All the steps we performed using Power Query editor can be performed using Visual query editor as well.

30. From the Visual query editor menu select **Save as view**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image26.png)

    Save as view dialog opens. Notice the SQL query is available. You can review it if you want to verify the SQL code.

31. Enter **Geo** as **View name**.

32. Select **OK** to save the view.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image27.png)

    You will get an alert once the view is saved.

33. In the Explorer (left) panel, expand **Views**. We have the newly created Geo view.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image28.png)

## Task 3: Create Reseller view using Visual Query

Let’s create the Reseller view which is created by merging Customers table with the BuyingGroups table. This time around we will create the view using Visual query without opening the Power Query option.

1. From the top menu, click the drop down next to **New SQL query (1)** and then select **New visual query (2)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image54.png)

2. To build a query, we need to add tables to the Visual Query panel. Click on the ellipsis next to the **BuyingGroups (1)** table and select **Insert into canvas (2)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image29.png)

3. Repeat the same steps for the **Customers** table.

4. **Select the Customers** query. When selected, Customers will have a **“+”** sign after Table (this indicates we are adding a step after Table. If you do not see the **“+”** sign after table, you may have selected a different step. Select Table and you will be good to go).

5. From the Visual query menu, select **Combine -> Merge queries**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image30.png)

    The Merge dialog opens with Customers selected as the top table.

6. In the **Right table for merge**, select **BuyingGroups**.

7. Select **BuyingGroupID** columns from both the tables. We are going to join using this column.

8. Select **Inner** as the **Join kind**.

9. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image31.png)

10. In the **Data view** (bottom panel), click on the **double arrow** next to the **BuyingGroups** column (last column to the right) to select the columns we need from BuyingGroups.

11. A panel opens. **Select the** **BuyingGroupName** column.

12. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image32.png)

    We do not need all the columns in our Customer table. Let’s select only those we need.

13. From the Visual query menu, select **Manage columns -> Choose columns**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image33.png)

14. Choose columns dialog opens. **Select** the following columns.

    1. ResellerID

    2. ResellerName

    3. PostalCityID

    4. PhoneNumber

    5. FaxNumber

    6. WebsiteURL

    7. DeliveryAddressLine1

    8. DeliveryAddressLine2

    9. DeliveryPostalCode

    10. PostalAddressLine1

    11. PostalAddressLine2

    12. PostalPostalCode

    13. BuyingGroupName

15. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image34.png)

16. Let’s rename BuyingGroupName column. In the **Data view, double-click on BuyingGroupName** column header to make it editable.

17. **Rename** the column to **ResellerCompany**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image35.png)

    Notice the Customer table has all the steps documented. Now let’s save this view.

18. We need to save the Customers query as it has all the steps. We need to Enable load. Select the **ellipsis** in the **Customers** query box.

19. Make sure **Enable load** is checked.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image36.png)

    >**Note:** The **Customer** box should have a blue border, if enable load is checked.

20. From the Visual query menu, select **Save as view**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image37.png)

9. Select **InvoiceID** columns from both the tables. We are going to join using this column.

10. Select **Inner** as the **Join kind**.

11. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image43.png)

    We are going to copy code from Power BI Desktop and paste it using the Advanced Editor.


12. If you have not already opened it, open **FAIAD.pbix** located in the **Reports** folder on the desktop of your lab environment.


13. From the ribbon select **Home -> Transform data**. Power Query window opens. As you have noticed in the earlier lab, queries in the left panel are organized by data source.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image44.png)


14. From the left **Queries** panel, under the **ADLSData** **(1)** folder, select **Sales (2)** query.


15. From the ribbon select **Home - > Advanced Editor (3)**. Advanced Editor dialog opens.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image45.png)

    >**Note:** If you're unable to find the Advanced Editor, you can access it under **Home -> Query -> Advanced Editor**.

21. From the ribbon select **Home -> Advanced Editor**. Advanced Editor dialog opens.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image47.png)


22. At the **end of line 2 add a comma** (Source = Table.NestedJoin(InvoiceLineItems, {"InvoiceID"}, Invoices, {"InvoiceID"}, "Invoices", JoinKind.Inner)**,**


23. Click **Enter** to start a new line.


24. Enter **Ctrl+V** on your keyboard to paste the code you copied from Power BI Desktop.

    >**Note:** If you are working in the lab environment, please select the **ellipsis (…)** on the top right of the screen. Use the slider to **enable** **VM Native Clipboard**. Select OK in the dialog. Once done pasting the queries you can disable this option.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image48.png)

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image49.png)


25. Highlight the last two lines of code (in Source) and **delete** it.


26. Select **OK** to save the changes.

    ![](../media/Lab-3/image50.png)

    If it is easier, delete all the code in the Advanced Editor and paste the below code into Advanced Editor.

    ```
    let
    Source = Table.NestedJoin(InvoiceLineItems, {"InvoiceID"}, Invoices, {"InvoiceID"}, "Invoices", JoinKind.Inner),
        #"Expanded Invoice" = Table.ExpandTableColumn(Source, "Invoices", {"CustomerID", "BillToCustomerID", "SalespersonPersonID", "InvoiceDate"}, {"CustomerID", "BillToCustomerID", "SalespersonPersonID", "InvoiceDate"}),
        #"Removed Other Columns" = Table.SelectColumns(#"Expanded Invoice",{"InvoiceLineID", "InvoiceID", "StockItemID", "Quantity", "UnitPrice", "TaxRate", "TaxAmount", "LineProfit", "ExtendedPrice", "CustomerID", "SalespersonPersonID", "InvoiceDate"}),
        #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(#"Removed Other Columns",{{"CustomerID", "ResellerID"}}),
        #"Merged Queries" = Table.NestedJoin(#"Renamed Columns", {"ResellerID"}, Reseller, {"ResellerID"}, "Customer", JoinKind.Inner),
        #"Added Custom" = Table.AddColumn(#"Merged Queries", "Sales Amount", each [ExtendedPrice] - [TaxAmount]),
        #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes(#"Added Custom",{{"Sales Amount", type number}}),
        #"Removed Columns" = Table.RemoveColumns(#"Changed Type",{"Customer"})
    in
        #"Removed Columns"
    ```

27. You will be navigated back to the Power Query Editor. In the left, Queries panel, **double-click on Merge** query to rename it.
