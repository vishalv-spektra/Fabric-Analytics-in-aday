# Introduction

We have ingested data from different data sources into the Lakehouse. In this lab, you will set up a refresh schedule for the data sources. Just to recap the requirement:

- **Supplier Data:** Snowflake is updated at midnight / 12 AM every day.

- **Employee Data:** in SharePoint is updated at 9 AM every day. However, we have noticed that sometimes there is a 5–15 minute delay. We need to create a refresh schedule to accommodate this.

- **Customer Data:** in Dataverse is always up to date. Previously we refreshed this four times a day, at midnight / 12 AM, 6 AM, noon / 12 PM, and 6 PM. Now, the IT team has created a link to Dataverse to ingest this data to an Admin Lakehouse. They have also transformed this data. We do not need to set up refresh as we are linking to the Lakehouse provided by the IT team.

- **Sales Data:** in ADLS is updated at noon / 12 PM every day. We do not need to set up refresh for this since we have created a shortcut. As soon as data is updated in ADLS, it is available.

By the end of this lab, you will have learned:

- How to configure a scheduled refresh of Dataflow Gen2

- How to create a Pipeline

- How to configure a scheduled refresh of a Pipeline

# Dataflow Gen2

## Task 1: Configure scheduled refresh for Supplier Dataflow

Let’s start by configuring a scheduled refresh of Supplier Dataflow.

1. Let’s navigate back to the Fabric workspace, **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>** by selecting the workspace in the left panel.


2. To maximize the panel with the list of artifacts, select the double arrow on the top right of the panel.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image6.png)


3. All the artifacts you have created are listed here. On the right of the screen, in the **Search box** enter **df**. This will filter the artifacts to Dataflows.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image7.png)


4. Hover over the **df_Supplier_Snowflake** row. Select the **ellipsis (…)**.


5. Notice there is option to Delete, Open, and Refresh the Dataflow. Let’s look at Refresh history. Select **Recent Runs**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image8.png)

    >**Note:** A window/panel will appear on the right side showing a list of refreshes


6. You will notice that there is a single refresh that executed when we selected the **Save and run** option in the previous lab. The **Type** of refresh we can see is listed as **On Demand**, which lets us know this was a manually executed refresh.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image9.png)


7. Select the **Start time** link.

    >**Note:** Start time will be different for you.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image10.png)

    Details screen will open. This will provide details of the refresh. It lists the start time, end time, and duration. It also lists the tables / activities that were refreshed. In case there is a failure, you can click on the name of the table / activity to investigate further.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image11.png)

8. Let’s navigate away, by clicking on the **X** on the top right corner. You will be navigated back to the **workspace**.

9. Hover over the **df_Supplier_Snowflake** row. Select the **ellipsis (…)**.

10. Let’s see how we can schedule a refresh to happen automatically. Choose the **Settings** option.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image12.png)

11. You will see in the **Settings** panel that appeared we have three options: 

    - **About –** Here we can change the name of the Dataflow and add a description. Also, we can see who is the owner of the dataflow and the last time it was modified.

    - **Endorsement –** This allows us to specify if the dataflow will carry the **Promoted** or the **Certified** tag for others to see.

    - **Schedule -** This is where we can schedule our dataflows.

        ![](../media/Lab-5/image13.png)

12. Select the **Schedule** option


13. To activate a schedule, we simply must click **Add Schedule**

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image14.png)


14. This now allows us to specify the cadence of the refresh by selecting an option for the **Repeat** property. For this scenario we can choose **Daily (1)**

15. For the **Time** property we can specify **12:00 AM** **(2)** since we want midnight

    >**Note:** By clicking on Add another time link, you can add multiple refresh times.


16. We can also specify a **Start date and time (3)** as well as an **End date and time (4)**. For this scenario simply choose whatever the current day is for the start date and the end date.


17. You can specify which **Time Zone (5)** you would like the times to represent. Lastly, select **Save**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image15.png)


18. You will see the scheduled refresh and be able to edit or delete it if it is no longer necessary or add other scheduled refreshes.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image16.png)

    As mentioned earlier, we need to build custom logic to handle the scenario where the Employee file in SharePoint is not delivered on time. Let’s use a Pipeline to solve this.

# Pipeline

## Task 2: Create Pipeline

1. Let’s navigate back to the Fabric workspace, **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>** by selecting the workspace in the left panel.

2. From the top menu select **+ New item (1) -> Pipeline (2)**. 

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image17.png)

3. A new pipeline dialog opens. Name the pipeline as **pl_Refresh_People_SharePoint** and select **Create**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image18.png)

    You are navigated to the **Pipeline page**. If you have worked with Azure Data Factory, this screen will be familiar. Let’s get a quick overview of the layout.

    You are on the **Home** screen. If you look at the top menu, you will find options to add the commonly used activities: validate, run a pipeline, and view the run history. Also, in the center pane, you will find quick options to start building the pipeline.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image19.png)


4. From the top menu select **Activities**. Now in the menu you will find a list of commonly used Activities.


5. Select the **ellipsis (…)** on the right on the menu to view all the other available Activities. We are going to use a few of these Activities in the lab.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image20.png)


6. From the top menu click **Run**. You will find options to run and schedule the pipeline execution. You will also find the option to view execution history by using View run history.


7. From the top menu select **View**. Here you will find options to view the code in JSON format. You will also find options to auto align the activities.

    >**Note:** If you have a JSON background, at the end of the lab, feel free to select View JSON code. Here you will notice all the orchestration you are doing using the design view can also be written in JSON.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image21.png)

## Task 3: Build simple Pipeline

Let’s start building the pipeline. We need an activity to refresh the Dataflow. Let’s find an activity which we can use.


1. From the top menu select **Activities -> Dataflow**. Dataflow activity is added to the center design pane. Notice the bottom pane now has configuration options of the Dataflow activity.


2. We are going to configure the activity to connect to df_People_SharePoint dataflow. From the **bottom** **pane**, select **Settings**.

    >**Note:** You may need to drag the bottom pane up to see settings.*

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image22.png)


3. Make sure **Workspace** is set to your Fabric workspace, **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

4. From the **Dataflow dropdown** select **df_People_SharePoint**. When this Dataflow activity is executed, it will refresh **df_People_SharePoint**. That was easy, right?

    In our scenario, Employee Data is not updated on a schedule. Sometimes there is a delay. Let’s see if we can accommodate this.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image23.png)

5. From the **bottom** **pane**, select **General**. Let’s give the activity a name and description.


6. In the **Name** field, enter **dfactivity_People_SharePoint**


7. In the **Description** field, enter **Dataflow activity to refresh df_People_SharePoint dataflow**.


8. Notice there is an option to Deactivate an activity. This feature is useful during testing or debugging. Leave it as **Activated**.


9. There is an option to set **Timeout**. Let’s leave the **default value** as is which should give enough time for the dataflow to refresh.

    >**Note:** Since the data is not available on a schedule, let’s set the activity to re-execute every 10 minutes, three times. If it fails on the third attempt as well, then it will report a failure.


10. Set **Retry** to **3**


11. Expand **Advanced** section.


12. Set **Retry interval (sec)** to **600**.


13. From the menu select **Home -> Save** icon to save the pipeline.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image24.png)

    Notice the advantage of using the pipeline compared to setting the dataflow on scheduled refresh (like we did for the earlier dataflow):

    - Pipeline provides the option to retry multiple times before failing the refresh.

    - Pipeline provides the ability to perform other tasks as well as refreshing the dataflow

## Task 4: Create new Pipeline

Let’s add a little more complexity to our scenario. We have noticed that if the data is not available at 9 AM, then typically it is available within five minutes. If the time window is missed, then it takes 15 minutes for the file to be available. We want to schedule the retries at five and 15 minutes. Let’s see how this can be achieved by creating a new Pipeline.

1. From the left panel, click **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**, to be navigated to the workspace home.

2. From the top menu, click **+ New item (1)** and from the popout window **,** click **Pipeline (2)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image25.png)

3. New pipeline dialog opens. **Name** the pipeline as **pl_Refresh_People_SharePoint_Option2 (3),** and select **Create (4)**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image26.png)

## Task 5: Create Until Activity

1. You will be navigated to the Pipeline screen. From the menu, select **Activities**.

2. Click the **ellipsis(…)** on the right.

3. From the activity list, click **Until**.

    **Until:** is an activity that is used to iterate until a condition is satisfied.

    In our scenario, we are going to iterate and refresh the dataflow until it is successful, or we have tried three times.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image27.png)

## Task 6: Create Variables

1. We need to create variables which will be used to iterate and set status. Select the **blank area** in the pipeline design pane.

2. Notice the menu in the bottom pane changes. Select **Variables**.

3. Select **+ New** to add a new variable.

4. Notice a row appears. Enter **varCounter** in the **Name text box**. We will use this variable to iterate three times.

5. From **Type** **dropdown** select **Integer**.

6. Enter **Default value** of **0**.

    >**Note:** we are appending variable names with var, so it is easy to find them, and it is good practice.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image28.png)

7. Select **+** **New** to add another new variable.

8. Notice a row appears. Enter **varTempCounter** in the **Name text box**. We are going to use this variable increment varCounter variable.

9. From **Type** **dropdown** select **Integer**.

10. Enter **Default value** of **0**.

11. Follow similar steps to add three more variables:

    1. **varIsSuccess** of type **String** and default value **No**. This variable will be used to indicate if the dataflow refresh was successful.

    2. **varSuccess** of type **String** and default value **Yes**. This variable will be used to set the value of varIsSuccess if dataflow refresh is successful.

    3. **varWaitTime** of type **Integer** and default value **60**. This variable will be used to set the wait time if dataflow fails. (Either 5 minutes/300 seconds or 15 minutes/900 seconds.)

        >**Note:** Make sure there is no space before or after the variable name.

        ![](../media/Lab-5/image29.png)

## Task 7: Configure Until Activity

1. Select **Until** activity.

2. From the **bottom pane**, select **General**.

3. Enter **Name** as **Iterator**

4. Enter **Description** as “**Iterator to refresh dataflow. It will retry up to 3 times**”.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image30.png)

5. From the bottom pane, select **Settings (1)**.

6. Select the **Expression text box (2)**. We need to enter an expression in this text box that will evaluate to true or false. The Until activity will continue to iterate while this expression evaluates to false. Once the expression evaluates to true, the Until activity stops the iteration and moves on to the next activity.

7. Select **Add dynamic content (3)** link that appears below the text box.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image31.png)

    We need to write an expression which would execute until either the value of **varCounter is 3** or value **varIsSuccess is Yes**. (varCounter and varIsSuccess are the variables we just created.)

8. **Pipeline expression builder** dialog opens. In the bottom half of the dialog, you will have a menu:

    1. **Parameters:** Values that are passed to the pipeline. E.g. Value from one pipeline passed to another pipeline. These values can be used in any expression but cannot be changed during the pipeline run.

    2. **System variables:** Can be used in expressions when defining entities within either service. E.g., pipeline id, pipeline name, trigger name, etc.

    3. **Trigger parameters:** Parameters that triggered the pipeline. E.g., File Name or Folder Path.

    4. **Functions:** You can call functions within expressions. Functions are categorized into Collection, Conversion, Date, Logical, Math, and String functions. E.g., concat is a String function, add is a Math function, etc.

    5. **Variables:** Pipeline variables are values that can be set and modified during a pipeline run. Unlike pipeline parameters, which are defined at the pipeline level and cannot be changed during a pipeline run, pipeline variables can be set and modified within a pipeline using a Set Variable activity. We are going to use Set Variable activity shortly.

    6. **Library variables:** Library Variables use variables that are defined in the **Variable Library Fabric Item**. These variables provide a centralized way to manage configurations across workspaces to support CI/CD workflows. They can be used alongside pipelines, notebooks, Lakehouse shortcuts, and more.

        ![](../media/Lab-5/image32.png)

9. Click **Functions** from the menu.

10. From the **Logical Functions** section, select **or** function. Notice **@or()** is added to the dynamic expression text box. The **or** function takes two parameters, we are working on the first parameter.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image33.png)


11. Place the cursor **in between the parentheses** of the **@or** function.


12. From the **Logical Functions** section, select **equals** function. Notice this is added to the dynamic expression text box.

    >**Note:** Your function should look like **@or(equals())**. The equals function also takes two parameters. We will be checking if the variable varCounter is equal to 3.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image34.png)


13. Now place the cursor **in between the parentheses** of **@equals** function to add the parameters.


14. From the bottom menu, select **Variables**.


15. Select **varCounter** variable which will be the first parameter.


16. Enter **3** as the second parameter of the equals function. Like the screenshot below, your expression will be **@or(equals(variables('varCounter'),3))**

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image35.png)


17. We need to add the second parameter to the **or** function. **Add a comma** in between the ending two parentheses. This time we will try typing in the function name. Start typing **equ** and you will get a dropdown of available functions (this is called IntelliSense). Select the **equals** function.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image36.png)


18. The first parameter of equals function is a variable. Place **cursor before the comma**.


19. Start typing **variables(**


20. With the help of IntelliSense select **variables('varIsSuccess')**


21. After the comma, let’s enter the second parameter. Start typing **variables(**


22. With the help of IntelliSense select **variables('varSuccess')**. Here we are comparing the value of varIsSuccess to the value of varSuccess. (varSuccess is defaulted to Yes.)

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image37.png)


23. Your expression should be:

    **@or(equals(variables('varCounter'),3),equals(variables('varIsSuccess'), variables('varSuccess')))**


24. Select **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image38.png)

## Task 8: Configure Dataflow Activity


1. You will be navigated back to the design screen. With **Until activity** selected, from the **bottom pane**, select **Activities**. We will now add the activities that need to be executed.


2. Select the **Edit icon** in the first row. You will be navigated to a blank iterator design screen.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image39.png)


3. From the top menu, select **Activities -> Dataflow**. Dataflow activity is added to the design pane.


4. With **Dataflow activity selected**, in the bottom pane select **General**. Let’s give the activity a name and description.


5. In the **Name** field, enter **dfactivity_People_SharePoint**


6. In the **Description** field, enter “**Dataflow activity to refresh df_People_SharePoint dataflow**”.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image40.png)


7. Select **Settings** from the bottom pane.


8. Make sure **Workspace** is set to your workspace, **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>**.


9. From the **Dataflow dropdown** select **df_People_SharePoint**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image41.png)

## Task 9: Configure 1<sup>st</sup> Set variable Activity

We have configured the Dataflow activity like we did earlier in the lab. Now we will add new logic. If the dataflow refresh is successful, we need to exit out of the Until iterator. Remember one of the conditions to exit the iterator is to set the value of varIsSuccess variable to Yes.

1. From the top menu, select **Activities -> Set variable**. Set variable activity is added to the design canvas.

2. With **Set variable activity** selected, in the bottom pane select **General**. Let’s give the activity a name and description.

3. In the **Name** field, enter **set_varIsSuccess**

4. In the **Description** field, enter “**Set variable varIsSuccess to Yes”**.

    >**Note:** Hover over **Dataflow activity**. To the right of the activity box there are four icons. These can be used to connect to the next activity based on the result of the activity:

    1. **Grey curved arrow** icon is used on skip of the activity.

    2. **Green check mark** icon is used on success of the activity.

    3. **Red x-mark** icon is used on failure of the activity.

    4. **Blue straight arrow** icon is used on completion of the activity.

5. Click the **green check mark** from dfactivity_People_SharePoint Dataflow activity and drag to connect to the new **set_varIsSuccess** **Set variable activity**. So, on success of dataflow refresh we want to execute the Set variable activity.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image42.png)

6. With **Set variable activity** selected, click **Settings** from the bottom menu.

7. In the bottom pane, make sure **Variable type** is **Pipeline variable**.

8. In the **Name** field, select **varIsSuccess**. This is the variable whose value we are going to set.

9. In the **Value** field, select the **text box**. Select **Add dynamic content** link.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image43.png)

10. Pipeline expression builder dialog opens. Select the **Add dynamic content below using any combination of expressions, functions, and system variables** text area **(1)**.

11. From the bottom menu, click on the **ellipses (...) (2)**, then select **Variables (3) -> varSuccess (4)**. Notice **@variables(‘varSuccess’)** is entered in the Add dynamic content below text area. Remember when we created variables, we had preset the value of varSuccess variable to Yes. So, we are assigning the value of Yes to the varIsSuccess variable.

12. Select **OK**. You will be navigated back to the **iterator design pane**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image44.png)

    Now we need to set the counter if the dataflow activity fails. In a Pipeline, we cannot self-reference a variable. Which means we cannot increment the counter variable varCounter by adding one to its value (varCounter = varCounter + 1). So, we make use of the varTempCounter variable.

## Task 10: Configure 2<sup>nd</sup> Set variable Activity

1. From the top menu, select **Activities -> Set variable**. Set variable activity is added to the design canvas.

2. With **Set variable activity** selected, in the bottom pane select **General**. Let’s give the activity a name and description.

3. In the **Name** field, enter **set_varTempCounter**

4. In the **Description** field, enter “**Increment variable varTempCounter”**.

5. Click the **red x-mark** from Dataflow activity to the new Set variable activity. So, on failure of dataflow refresh we want to execute this Set variable activity.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image45.png)

6. With **Set variable activity** selected, select **Settings** from the bottom menu.

7. In the bottom pane, make sure **Variable type** is **Pipeline variable**.

8. In the **Name** field, select **varTempCounter**. This is the variable whose value we are going to set.

9. In the **Value** field, select the **text box**. Select **Add dynamic content** link.

10. Pipeline expression builder dialog opens. Enter **@add(variables('varCounter'),1)**

    >**Note:** Feel free to type this expression in, use the menu to select the functions, or copy and paste it. This function is setting the value of variable varTempCounter to the value of variable varCounter plus one, (varTempCounter = varCounter + 1).

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image46.png)

    Now we need to set the value of varCounter variable to the value of varTempCounter.

## Task 11: Configure 3<sup>rd</sup> Set variable Activity

1. From the top menu, select **Activities -> Set variable**. Set variable activity is added to the design canvas.

2. With **Set variable activity** selected, in the bottom pane select **General**. Let’s give the activity a name and description.

3. In the **Name** field, enter **set_varCounter**

4. In the **Description** field, enter “**Increment variable varCounter”**.

5. Click the **green check mark** from set_varTempCounter Set variable activity and drag to connect to the new **set_varCounter Set variable activity**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image47.png)

6. With **set_varCounter Set variable activity** selected, click **Settings** from the bottom menu.

7. In the bottom pane, make sure **Variable type** is **Pipeline variable**.

8. In the **Name** field, select **varCounter**. This is the variable whose value we are going to set.


9. In the **Value** field, select the **text box**. Select **Add dynamic content** link.


10. Pipeline expression builder dialog opens. Enter **@variables('varTempCounter')**. Feel free to type this expression in, or use the menu to select the functions, or copy and paste it in.

11. Click on **OK**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image48.png)

    >**Note:** This function sets the value of variable varCounter to the value of variable varTempCounter (varCounter = varTempCounter). At the end of each iteration both varCounter and varTempCounter have the same value.

## Task 12: Configure Wait Activity

Next, we need to wait for 5 minutes/300 seconds if dataflow refresh fails the first time before trying again. If the dataflow refresh fails for the second time, we need to wait 15 minutes/900 seconds and try again. We are going to use Wait activity and variable varWaitTime to set the wait time.


1. From the top menu, select **Activities -> ellipsis (…) -> Wait**. Wait activity is added to the design canvas.


2. With the **Wait activity** selected, in the bottom pane select **General**. Let’s give the activity a name and description.


3. In the **Name** field, enter **wait_onFailure**


4. In the **Description** field, enter “**Wait for 300 seconds on 2nd try and 900 seconds on 3rd try”**.


5. Click the **green check mark** from set_varCounter Set variable activity and drag to connect to the new **wait_onFailure Wait activity**.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image49.png)


6. With **Wait activity** selected, click **Settings** from the bottom menu.


7. In the **Wait time in seconds** field, select the **text box** and select **Add dynamic content** link.


8. Pipeline expression builder dialog opens. Enter

   ```
   @if(
       greater(variables('varCounter'), 1),
       if(equals(variables('varCounter'), 2),
           mul(variables('varWaitTime'),15 ),
           mul(variables('varWaitTime'), 0)
       ),
       mul(variables('varWaitTime'),5 )
   )
   ```

    Feel free to type this expression in, or use the menu to select the functions, or copy and paste it in.

    ![](../media/Lab-5/image50.png)

    We are using two new functions here:

    - **greater:** Takes two numbers as parameters and compares which one is greater.

    - **mul:** This is a multiply function, it takes in two parameters to multiply.

    The expression is a nested if statement. It is checking if the value of varCounter variable is greater than 1.

    If it is true, it checks if the value of varCounter variable is 2. If it is true, it sets the wait time to varWaitTime times 15. Remember, we had defaulted varWaitTime value to 60. That would be 60*15 = 900 seconds. If the value of varCounter variable is not 2 (it is greater than 2, which means the dataflow refresh has failed 3 times), we are done iterating. We don’t have to wait anymore, so the wait time is set to varWaitTime * 0. So, to 0. If the value of varCounter variable is 1, then we multiply varWaitTime * 5. That would be 60*5 = 300 seconds.

9. Select **OK**.

    **Checkpoint:** Your **Until** iterator should look like the screenshot below.

10. From the top left of the design canvas select **pl_Refresh_People_Sharepoint_Option2** or **Main Canvas** to be navigated out of Until iterator.

11. We are done creating the pipeline. From the top menu, select **Home -> Save icon** to save the pipeline.

## Task 13: Configure Schedule Refresh for Pipeline

1. We can test the pipeline by selecting **Home -> Run**.
         
    >**Note:** It may take a few minutes for the pipeline to complete a refresh. This is a training environment, so the file in SharePoint is always available. Hence, your pipeline will never fail.

2. We can set the pipeline to execute on a schedule. From the top menu, select **Home -> Schedule**. Schedule dialog opens.

3. Select the **+ Add Schedule** button below **Scheduled run**.

4. Set **Repeat dropdown** to **Daily**.

5. Set **Time** to **9 AM**.

6. Set **Start date and time** to **Today**.

7. Set **End date and time** to a **future date**.

8. Set your **time zone**.

    >**Note:** Since this is a lab environment, you can set the time zone to your preferred time zone. In a real scenario, you will be setting the time zone based on your data source location.

9. Select **Save**.

10. Select the **X** mark on the top right of the dialog to close it.

11. Select your Fabric workspace **FAIAD_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false"/>** in the left panel to navigate to the workspace.

    >**Note:** In the Schedule screen, there is no option to notify on success or failure (like Dataflow Schedule). Notification can be done by adding an activity in the pipeline. We are not doing it in this lab because this is a lab environment.

    We have scheduled refreshes for the various data sources. We will create a semantic model with relationships, measures and other modeling operations in the next lab.
